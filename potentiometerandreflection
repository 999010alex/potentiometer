# potentiometer
1)Describe this project in your own words. 
The potentiometer works by changing the amount of electricity going in 3 wires. This works with the RGB LED
to create a color spectrum. 
2)Describe all the lines of code and their meaning ( variables and functions)
You set a color using the color value spectrum, which is a numerical spectrum. It goes from 0-1023, and it was programed to 
red if the charge is under 255, which can be modified by the Potentiometer. It changes it to green if it is in between 
under 660, and if it is over that, it changes the color to blue.
3)How many combinations of colors could your RGB LED output?
You can have 1023 combinations of colors. 
4)How have you modified the project to have the RGB LED generate more colors? What colors have you added/modified? 
5)What have you learned in this project? 
That there are so many diffrent colors that you cam choose. 
6)How would you extend this project to make it more interesting? Explain.
Adding even more combinations of colors, as well as diffrent colors for diffrent currents.
